## Contributing recipes

Thanks for your interest in contributing recipes!

Any recipes are welcome but here's what we currently need most:
- Submissions
    - Drinks (alcoholic and non-*)
    - Baking
    - Desserts
    - Anything that isn't currently listed as a category
- Website
    - I'm still new to web design so if you see something you can't stand, make a PR or issue saying what you'd like us to try out.

### Via Issue Request

Click the `Issues` tab and select `New issue`. Add the title of your dish, all the ingredients, the steps for the recipe, and a picture of the end product. I'll manually create the post and add it to the recipe branch.

### Via Pull Request

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/MostlyHarmlessCafe/Mostly-Harmless-Cafe.git`

Create your entry with `hugo new content/post/recipe-title.md` (if you don't have Hugo, install it, it should be in most mainstream repos).

Modify the frontmatter to include the following information (anything with a `< >`, remove the brackets)

```
deadbody13.github.io/content/posts/<recipe-title>.md

title: "<Recipe Title>"
date: 2023-06-17T16:39:03-04:00

#### Formatting Your PR

##### Tags

Tags are used to categorize the food and drinks and sort them into their respective pages. All posts should generally include either a food or drink tag and any other tags that you think should apply.

The current tags are:
- food (include with all food posts)
    - burgers
    - chicken
    - pasta
    - sauce
- Drinks (include with all drinks)
    - alcoholic
    - non-alcoholic
 
If you don't see a tag here that you think should be included with your recipe, go ahead and list it in the front-matter like all the other tags. If I see enough food/drink items for a particular tag (like `baking`, `desserts`, etc.) I'll add it to the menu and it's better to include too many tags than not enough.

##### Organization

Entries should have at least an `# Ingredients` (unordered) and `# Instructions` (ordered) section. You can also include a section at the end `# Footnotes` (ordered).

##### Footnotes
In-line: these are the in-text citation and are just numbers referencing the footnote at the bottom. Can be either a single number or multiple if more than one footnote exists for this item.
```
***- [1]***
***- [2]***
...
***- [n]***
```
Footnote: these are the actual footnotes at the bottom referencing the in-line citations. The `<div class="footnotes"` is necessary because there is a footnotes class to distinguish it from the rest of the post.
```
<div class="footnotes">

# Footnotes
1. Footnote 1
1. Footnote 2
...
1. Footnote n

</div>
```

##### Previewing
The following command is used to host the website locally. It will then be accessible via `https://localhost:1313/` or something like that.

```
hugo server -D
```

## Furthermore
Try not to include stories, epiphanies on life, embarrassing moments from high school, that time you scraped your knee, or other stuff that people may feel the need to scroll past to get to the recipe itself.

## Contributing to the Website
Have something you think would make the website better (styling, layouts, etc.)? Submit a PR and we'll look into it.
